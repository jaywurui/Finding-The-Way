## Overview

Finding the way is an interactive story-based explorable explanation design for helping users learn the Dijkstra’s algorithm, an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph (Wikipedia). This interactive visualization design makes the abstract and complex concepts concrete and effortless, helping the users uncover the concepts behind the shortest path and learn the basic concepts in a more interesting and accurate manner. With the goal of making the algorithm easy and fun to learn and understand, we created a themed story for the explorable explanation design so that users can better comprehend the challenge to help Jack’s family get to their destinations via the shortest route. Based on the idea of learning by doing, we designed the tool to present the users with interactively seeing well connected edges and help them make decisions on individual steps that connect and complete the implementation table for the algorithm. In the end, users can understand the calculation process of the Dijkstra’s algorithm and are able to find the shortest paths for Jack’s family.
